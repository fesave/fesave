### Hey guys! Fernando Sanz here! ðŸ‘‹

Android Developer. I currently spend most of my time developing my own applications for Android devices, learning in a self-taught way and trying to be informed with the latest news. In turn, I am interested in new programming languages, such as Kotlin or Swift.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Jetpack compose ðŸ¤˜ and Swift ï£¿
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on OpenSource Projects.
